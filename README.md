# UFOs Sightings

UFOs sightings data visualization with JavaScript

#### Overview
The UFOs page is composed by an article on the subject with its corresponding Title and a table containing all the  data of sightings over the years. A set of filters allow the user to filter the table to their liking by simply introducing the data required and hitting the "Filter Table" button. If no data were found a massage will appear warn the user.

#### Resources
Data Sources: data.js.
Software: Google Chrome 84.0.4147.125 3.7.7, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.45.1.

#### Future development suggestions
* The first suggestion would be to make the article dynamic, either combining with and API or in this case that the creator is a journalist, and writing the article is supposed to be part of her job, then extract the content from a file located in the project.
* The filters could be dropdowns to select the data from. Once one is selected only available options in the rest of the filters will be displayed. This would reduce the times when "No data found" is returned.
